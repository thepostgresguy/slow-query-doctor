## Code Style & Guidelines

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style
- Use type hints where possible
- Write clear docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add or update tests for new features and bug fixes
- Run `black` and `flake8` before submitting your PR
- Keep PRs focused and minimal; avoid unrelated changes
- Ensure you have `pyyaml`, `tqdm`, and all dev dependencies installed (see README)
- Reference `.slowquerydoctor.yml` for config-driven tests if needed

## Commit Messages

- Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style when possible
- Example: `fix(parser): handle multiline queries in log parser`

### Commit message guidelines

- Structure: `type(scope): short description` (e.g. `feat(parser): add EXPLAIN support`)
- Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `ci`
- Include a scope when relevant (e.g. `parser`, `llm`, `helm`)
- Use imperative, present tense: `fix`, not `fixed` or `fixes`
- For release bumps: `chore(release): bump VERSION to vX.Y.Z`

Our CI enforces commit message format; if commits fail linting, update them with interactive rebase:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~5
# edit commit messages
git push --force-with-lease
```
